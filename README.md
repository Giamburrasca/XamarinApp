# Xamarin App

&nbsp;

The application for the management of a bathing establishment was created with the idea of providing an additional service to modernise and, above all, speed up the experience between the user and the bathing establishment itself. 
That is, it wants to propose intuitive solutions to users through a simple interface that is always at hand and ready to use.

In detail, the application offers a complete overview of the establishment and the services it makes available to bathers, so that they can get to know it even before they come into contact with it.

This is another and older version of the iOS app that you can find [here](https://github.com/ettorezamponi/Umbrella)
